" FAQ {{{1
" What's the meaning of ...?{{{2
" %<{{{3
"
" It means: "you can truncate what comes right after".
"
"     $ vim -Nu NONE +'set ls=2|set stl=abcdef%<ghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' +'10vs'
"     abcdef<xyz~
"
" Notice how  the *start* of  the text `ghi...xyz`  has been truncated,  not the
" end. This is why `<`  was chosen for the item `%<` (and not  `>`), and this is
" why `<` is positioned *before* the truncated text.
"
" However, if  the text that  comes before  `%<` is too  long, Vim will  have to
" truncate it too:
"
"     $ vim -Nu NONE +'set ls=2 stl=abcdefghijklmn%<opqrstuvwxyz' +'10vs'
"     abcdefghi>~
"
" Notice  that  this time,  it's  the  *end* of  the  *previous*  text which  is
" truncated, and that `>` is positioned after it.
"
" To summarize:
" `%<` describes a point from which Vim can truncate the text if needed.
" It starts by truncating as much text as necessary right *after* the point.
" If that's not enough, it goes on by truncating the text right *before* the point.
"
"     very long %< text
"
" If  "very long  text" is  too long  for  the status  line, Vim  will start  by
" truncating the start of " text":
"
"     very long %< text
"                 ---->
"                 as much as necessary
"
" and if truncating all of " text"  is not enough, it will then truncate the end
" of "very long ":
"
"     very long %< text
"     <---------
"     as much as necessary
"
" ---
"
" If you omit `%<`,  Vim assumes it's at the start, and  truncates from the very
" beginning:
"
"     $ vim -Nu NONE +'set ls=2 stl=abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' +'10vs'
"     <rstuvwxyz~
"
" ---
"
" To control truncations, you must use:
"
"    - `%<` outside `%{}`
"    - `.123` inside `%{}` (e.g. `%.123{...}`)
"
" Note that `.123` truncates the start of the text, just like `%<`.

" %(%) {{{3
"
" Useful to set the desired width / justification of a group of items.
"
" Example:
"
"      ┌ left justification
"      │ ┌ width of the group
"      │ │
"      │ │ ┌ various items inside the group (%l, %c, %V)
"      │ │ ├─────┐
"     %-15(%l,%c%V%)
"     │           ├┘
"     │           └ end of group
"     │
"     └ beginning of group
"       the percent is separated from the open parenthesis because of the width field
"
" For more info, `:h 'stl`:
"
" > ( - Start of item group.  Can  be used for setting the width and alignment
" >                           of a section.  Must be followed by %) somewhere.
"
" > ) - End of item group.    No width fields allowed.

" -123  field {{{3

" Set the width of a field to 123 cells.
"
" Can be used (after the 1st percent sign) with all kinds of items:
"
"    - `%l`
"    - `%{...}`
"    - `%(...%)`
"
" Useful to append a space to an item, but only if it's not empty:
"
"     %-12item
"         ├──┘
"         └ suppose that the width of the item is 11
"
" The width  of the field  is one unit  greater than the one  of the item,  so a
" space will be added; and the left-justifcation  will cause it to appear at the
" end (instead of the beginning).

" .123  field {{{3
"
" Limit the width of an item to 123 cells:
"
"     %.123item
"
" Can be used (after the 1st percent sign) with all kinds of items:
"
"    - `%l`
"    - `%{...}`
"    - `%(...%)`
"
" Truncation occurs with:
"
"    - a '<' at the start for text items
"    - a '>' at the end for numeric items (only `maxwid - 2` digits are kept)
"      the number after '>' stands for how many digits are missing
" How to set a flag in the tabpage scope?{{{2
"
" Like for any other scope:
"
"     au User MyFlags call statusline#hoist('tabpage', '[on]')
"
" However, if your flag depends on the tab page in which it's displayed, you may
" need the special placeholder `{tabnr}`. For  example, to include the number of
" windows inside a tab page, you would write:
"
"     au User MyFlags call statusline#hoist('tabpage', '[%{tabpagewinnr({tabnr}, "$")}]')
"                                                                       ^^^^^^^
"
" If your expression  is too complex to  fit directly in the  function call, and
" you  need to  compute the  flag via  another function,  make sure  to pass  it
" `{tabnr}` as an argument:
"                                                            vvvvvvv
"     au User MyFlags call statusline#hoist('tabpage', 'Func({tabnr})')
"     fu Func(tabnr)
"             ^^^^^
"         " compute the flag using `a:tabnr` to refer to the tab page number
"                                   ^^^^^^^
"         return '...'

    " What are the "buffer", "window", "tabpage" and "global" scopes?{{{
    "
    " A flag may give an information about:
    "
    "    - a buffer; we say it's in the *buffer scope*
    "    - a window; we say it's in the *window scope*

    " By convention, we display a flag in:
    "
    "    - the buffer scope, on the left of the status line
    "    - the window scope, on the right of the status line
    "    - the tabpage scope, at the end of a tab label
    "    - the global scope, on the right of the tab line
    "
    " That's more or less what `vim-flagship` does.
    " This is a useful convention because it makes a flag give more information;
    " its position tells us what is affected.
    "}}}
    " What is a "volatile" flag?{{{
    "
    " For any given flag, you should consider 2 characteristics:
    "
    "    - how frequent is it displayed?
    "    - how stable is it?
    "
    " During a one-hour Vim  session, if a flag A is  displayed for ten minutes,
    " and a flag B for five minutes, A is more **frequent** than B.
    " But if A  is on for one minute,  then off for one minute, then  on for one
    " minute etc.  while B is  on for five consecutive  minutes, then B  is more
    " **stable** than A.
    "
    " The  more  stable/frequent  a  flag  is,  the more  on  the  left  of  the
    " buffer/tabpage scope  – or on  the right of  the window/global scope  – it
    " should be.
    "}}}
    " I have 2 flags A and B in the same scope.  I don't know which one should be displayed first!{{{
    "
    " Ask yourself this: how frequently could I be in a situation where B is on,
    " and the state of A changes (on → off, off → on)?
    "
    " If the answer is "often", then B should be displayed:
    "
    "    - before A if they are in the buffer/tabpage scope
    "    - after A if they are in the tabpage/global scope
    "
    " The goal is to prevent as much  as possible that a recently displayed flag
    " disturbs the positions of existing flags.
    "
    " ---
    "
    " Don't think about it too much. Tweak the priorities by experimentation.
    " If  the display  of  A often  disturbs  the position  of  B, increase  A's
    " priority so that it's greater than B's priority.
    "}}}
    " For the priorities, what type of numbers should I use?{{{

        " But what is the expression to get this number?
        " Answer:
        " We need to consider two cases depending on whether `lasttab - curtab >= 2`
        " is true or false.
        "
        " If it's true, it  means that we're not near enough the  end of the tabline
        " to worry; we are in the general case for which `max_dist = 2` is correct.
        "
        " If it's false, it means that we're too  close from the end, and we need to
        " increase `max_dist`.
        " By how much? The difference between the operands:
        "
        "     2 - (lasttab - curtab)
        "
        " The pseudo-code to get `max_dist` is thus:
        "
        "     if lasttab - curtab >= 2
        "         max_dist = 2
        "     else
        "         max_dist = 2 + (2 - (lasttab - curtab))
        "
        " Now we also need to handle the case where we're too close from the *start*
        " of the tabline:
        "
        "     if curtab - 1 >= 2
        "         max_dist = 2
        "     else
        "         max_dist = 2 + (2 - (curtab - 1))
