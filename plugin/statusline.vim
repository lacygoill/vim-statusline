" Same issue if we start Vim with `-O`.

" I think the  issue is that BufWinEnter  or WinEnter is probably  fired for all

"
"     au BufWinEnter,WinEnter  *  setl stl=%!statusline#main(1)

"
" `main(1)` will be evaluated only for the window to which we give the focus.
" But `main(0)` will be evaluated for ANY window which doesn't have the focus.
" And `main(0)` will be evaluated every time the statuslines must be redrawn,
" which happens every time we change the focus from a window to another.
" This means that when you write the 1st expression:
"

" ... you  must NOT assume  that this expression will  only be evaluated  in the

    " But what is the expression to get this number?
    " Answer:
    " We need to consider two cases depending on whether `lasttab - curtab >= 2`
    " is true or false.
    "
    " If it's true, it  means that we're not near enough the  end of the tabline
    " to worry; we are in the general case for which `max_dist = 2` is correct.
    "
    " If it's false, it means that we're too  close from the end, and we need to
    " increase `max_dist`.
    " By how much? The difference between the operands:
    "
    "     2 - (lasttab - curtab)
    "
    " The pseudo-code to get `max_dist` is thus:
    "
    "     if lasttab - curtab >= 2
    "         max_dist = 2
    "     else
    "         max_dist = 2 + (2 - (lasttab - curtab))
    "
    " Now we also need to handle the case where we're too close from the *start*
    " of the tabline:
    "
    "     if curtab - 1 >= 2
    "         max_dist = 2
    "     else
    "         max_dist = 2 + (2 - (curtab - 1))
    "
    " Finally, we have to merge the two snippets:
    "
    "     sdfe = min([curtab - 1, lasttab - curtab])
    "     if sdfe >= 2
    "         max_dist = 2
    "     else
    "         max_dist = 2 + (2 - sdfe)
    "
    " Which can be generalized to an arbitrary number of labels, by replacing `2` with `x`:
    "
    "     sdfe = min([curtab - 1, lasttab - curtab])
    "     if sdfe >= x
    "         max_dist = x
