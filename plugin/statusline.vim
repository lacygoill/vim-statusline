# FAQ {{{1
# What's the meaning of ...?{{{2
# %<{{{3
#
# It means: "you can truncate what comes right after".
#
#     $ vim -Nu NONE +'set ls=2|set stl=abcdef%<ghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' +'10vs'
#     abcdef<xyz~
#
# Notice how  the *start* of  the text `ghi...xyz`  has been truncated,  not the
# end.  This is why `<` was chosen for  the item `%<` (and not `>`), and this is
# why `<` is positioned *before* the truncated text.
#
# However, if  the text that  comes before  `%<` is too  long, Vim will  have to
# truncate it too:
#
#     $ vim -Nu NONE +'set ls=2 stl=abcdefghijklmn%<opqrstuvwxyz' +'10vs'
#     abcdefghi>~
#
# Notice  that  this time,  it's  the  *end* of  the  *previous*  text which  is
# truncated, and that `>` is positioned after it.
#
# To summarize:
# `%<` describes a point from which Vim can truncate the text if needed.
# It starts by truncating as much text as necessary right *after* the point.
# If that's not enough, it goes on by truncating the text right *before* the point.
#
#     very long %< text
#
# If  "very long  text" is  too long  for  the status  line, Vim  will start  by
# truncating the start of " text":
#
#     very long %< text
#                 ---->
#                 as much as necessary
#
# and if truncating all of " text"  is not enough, it will then truncate the end
# of "very long ":
#
#     very long %< text
#     <---------
#     as much as necessary
#
# ---
#
# If you omit `%<`,  Vim assumes it's at the start, and  truncates from the very
# beginning:
#
#     $ vim -Nu NONE +'set ls=2 stl=abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' +'10vs'
#     <rstuvwxyz~
#
# ---
#
# To control truncations, you must use:
#
#    - `%<` outside `%{}`
#    - `.123` inside `%{}` (e.g. `%.123{...}`)
#
# Note that `.123` truncates the start of the text, just like `%<`.

# %(%) {{{3
#
# Useful to set the desired width / justification of a group of items.
#
# Example:
#
#      ┌ left justification
#      │ ┌ width of the group
#      │ │
#      │ │ ┌ various items inside the group (%l, %c, %V)
#      │ │ ├─────┐
#     %-15(%l,%c%V%)
#     │           ├┘
#     │           └ end of group
#     │
#     └ beginning of group
#       the percent is separated from the open parenthesis because of the width field
#
# For more info, `:h 'stl`:
#
#    > ( - Start of item group.  Can  be used for setting the width and alignment
#    >                           of a section.  Must be followed by %) somewhere.
#
#    > ) - End of item group.    No width fields allowed.

# -123  field {{{3

# Set the width of a field to 123 cells.
#
# Can be used (after the 1st percent sign) with all kinds of items:
#
#    - `%l`
#    - `%{...}`
#    - `%(...%)`
#
# Useful to append a space to an item, but only if it's not empty:
#
#     %-12item
#         ├──┘
#         └ suppose that the width of the item is 11
#
# The width  of the field  is one unit  greater than the one  of the item,  so a
# space will be added; and the left-justifcation  will cause it to appear at the
# end (instead of the beginning).

# .123  field {{{3
#
# Limit the width of an item to 123 cells:
#
#     %.123item
#
# Can be used (after the 1st percent sign) with all kinds of items:
#
#    - `%l`
#    - `%{...}`
#    - `%(...%)`
#
# Truncation occurs with:
#
#    - a '<' at the start for text items
#    - a '>' at the end for numeric items (only `maxwid - 2` digits are kept)
#      the number after '>' stands for how many digits are missing
#}}}2
# What's the difference between `g:statusline_winid` and `g:actual_curwin`?{{{2
#
# The former can be used in a `%!` expression, the latter inside a `%{}` item.

# How to make sure two consecutive flags A and B are visually well separated?{{{2
#
# If the length of A is fixed (e.g. 12), and A is not highlighted:
#
#     %-13{item}
#      ├─┘
#      └ make the length of the flag one cell longer than the text it displays
#        and left-align it
#
# You could also append a space manually:
#
#     '%{item} '
#             ^
#
# But the space would be displayed unconditionally which you probably don't want.
#
# ---
#
# If the length of A is fixed, and A *is* highlighted, don't try to append a
# space; it would get highlighted which would be ugly.
#
# ---
#
# If  the length  of A  can  vary, highlight  it  with a  HG different  than
# `StatusLine` so that it clearly stands out.

# What are the "buffer", "window", "tabpage" and "global" scopes?{{{2
#
# A flag may give an information about:
#
#    - a buffer; we say it's in the *buffer scope*
#    - a window; we say it's in the *window scope*
#    - all buffers in a tabpage; we say it's in the *tabpage scope*
#    - some setting which applies to all buffers/windows/tabpages; we say it's in the *global scope*
#
# By convention, we display a flag in:
#
#    - the buffer scope, on the left of the status line
#    - the window scope, on the right of the status line
#    - the tabpage scope, at the end of a tab label
#    - the global scope, on the right of the tab line
#
# That's more or less what `vim-flagship` does.
# This is a useful convention because it makes a flag give more information;
# its position tells us what is affected.

# How to set a flag in the tabpage scope?{{{2
#
# Like for any other scope:
#
#     au User MyFlags statusline#hoist('tabpage', '[on]')
#
# However, if your flag depends on the tab page in which it's displayed, you may
# need the special placeholder `{tabnr}`.  For example, to include the number of
# windows inside a tab page, you would write:
#
#     au User MyFlags statusline#hoist('tabpage', '[%{tabpagewinnr({tabnr}, "$")}]')
#                                                                  ^-----^
#
# If your expression  is too complex to  fit directly in the  function call, and
# you  need to  compute the  flag via  another function,  make sure  to pass  it
# `{tabnr}` as an argument:
#                                                       v-----v
#     au User MyFlags statusline#hoist('tabpage', 'Func({tabnr})')
#     def Func(tabnr): string
#              ^---^
#         # compute the flag using `tabnr` to refer to the tab page number
#                                   ^---^
#         return '...'
#     enddef

# What is a "volatile" flag?{{{2
#
# If a flag  A is on for  one minute, then off  for one minute, then  on for one
# minute etc. while a flag B is on  for five consecutive minutes, then A is more
# **volatile** than B.
#
# The more volatile a flag is, the more on the right of the buffer/tabpage scope
# –  or on  the left  of the  window/global scope  – it  should be,  so that  it
# disturbs the position of as fewer flags as possible.

# I have 2 flags A and B in the same scope.  I don't know which one should be displayed first!{{{2
#
# Ask yourself this: how frequently could I be in a situation where B is on,
# and the state of A changes (on → off, off → on)?
#
# If the answer is "often", then B should be displayed:
#
#    - before A if they are in the buffer/tabpage scope
#    - after A if they are in the tabpage/global scope
#
# The goal is to prevent as much  as possible that a recently displayed flag
# disturbs the positions of existing flags.
#
# ---
#
# Don't think about it too much.  Tweak the priorities by experimentation.
# If  the display  of  A often  disturbs  the position  of  B, increase  A's
# priority so that it's greater than B's priority.

# For the priorities, what type of numbers should I use?{{{2
#
# Follow this  useful convention: any  flag installed from this  file should
# have a priority which is a multiple of 10.
# For flags installed from third-party plugins, use priorities which are not
# multiples of 10.
#
# I have a flag checking whether the value of an option has been altered.{{{2
# It is still displayed even when I restore the original value of the option!{{{3
#
# For a comma-separated list of items, the order matters.
# Your new  value may contain  the same  items as the  original value, but  in a
# different order.
#
#    1. you should not restore the option manually;
#       your plugin/script  should do  it, and  it should  not use  a "relative"
#       assignment operator like `+=`, but an "absolute" one like `=`
#
#    2. if your plugin/script  fails to restore the option, and  you need to
#       quickly fix it, just reload your  buffer (for a buffer-local option) or
#       restart Vim (for a global option)
#
# You could try to make the flags insensitive  to the order of the items, but it
# would add some complexity for a too small benefit.
# If one day you try to make them insensitive, make sure our `:Vo` command still
# works as expected.

    # Problem:

    # Suppose we focus the last but two tab page, the tabline becomes:

    #     | | | a | a | A | a | a
    #
    # Now suppose we focus the last but one tab page, the tabline becomes:

    #     | | | | a | a | A | a

    # Notice how the tabline  only contains 4 named labels, while  it had 5 just

    #
    # It appears that focusing the last but  one tab page is a special case, for
    # which `max_dist` should be `3` and not `2`.
    # Similarly, when we focus  the last tab page, we need  `max_dist` to be `4`

    #     | | | a | a | a | a | A
    #           ^   ^
    #           to get those, we need `max_dist = 4`

    #
    # But what is the expression to get this number?
    # Answer:
    # We need to consider two cases depending on whether `lasttab - curtab >= 2`
    # is true or false.
    #
    # If it's true, it  means that we're not near enough the  end of the tabline
    # to worry; we are in the general case for which `max_dist = 2` is correct.
    #
    # If it's false, it means that we're too  close from the end, and we need to
    # increase `max_dist`.
    # By how much? The difference between the operands:
    #
    #     2 - (lasttab - curtab)
    #
    # The pseudo-code to get `max_dist` is thus:
    #
    #     if lasttab - curtab >= 2
    #         max_dist = 2
    #     else
    #         max_dist = 2 + (2 - (lasttab - curtab))
    #
    # Now we also need to handle the case where we're too close from the *start*
    # of the tabline:
    #
    #     if curtab - 1 >= 2
    #         max_dist = 2
    #     else
    #         max_dist = 2 + (2 - (curtab - 1))
    #
    # Finally, we have to merge the two snippets:
    #
    #     sdfe = min([curtab - 1, lasttab - curtab])
    #     if sdfe >= 2
    #         max_dist = 2
    #     else
    #         max_dist = 2 + (2 - sdfe)
    #
    # Which  can be generalized to  an arbitrary number of  labels, by replacing
    # `2` with a variable `x`:
    #
    #     sdfe = min([curtab - 1, lasttab - curtab])
    #     if sdfe >= x
    #         max_dist = x

#     - If all tests succeed, the value which is used is `tail`.
#       It's the only one which isn't paired with any test.
